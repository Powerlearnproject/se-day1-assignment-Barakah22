#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering methods,principles and tools to devlop and amintain high quality softwares.
It enables the creation of software applications and systems that powers through various aspects of life such as communication,commerce entertainment and healthcare
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
the development of programming language
the advent of structured programming in 1970s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design:creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation:Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing:conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment:releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance:providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall:involves sequental approach with distinct phases such as requirement, design and implementations
agile: involves iterative and incremental approach such as flexibility,collaboration and adaptation.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer:writes codes and implements software solutions
quality assurance enginer: ensures the software qualit by desinging and implementing test plans
project manager: ensures and oversees the execution, planning and delivery of softwares projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environments: are tools that provide comprehensive tools for writing coding and debugging.e.g. visual studio
version control systems: are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinatinng wotk among team member.e.g. Git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements;a software should undergoes rigourous testing before finailisation so as to avoid changing the requirements and should be develop in a way that will adapts to changes in the development life cycle
Technical debts; shortcuts should be avoided
tight deadliness: software products should not be a rushed projects
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: testing individual components or module component
integration testin: involves differents components
system testting: testing the system as a whole
Acceptance testing: testing the software against the users requirement to ensure it meets its user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the systematic crafting of promptsm or set of instructiions to an Al model in order to get the best responses from the robot or language model.
the importance is to create prompt that lead to high quality responses from the language model by selecting the right phrases and words to use in the prompts
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt:explain nursing
imporved prompt: explain nursing in a layman's term and stating the importance
the improved prompt is effective because thr prompts is clear and concsice
